    <h4>
        Lasagna is the ultimate comfort food, combining layers of rich flavors and textures into a hearty, 
        satisfying dish. This classic recipe begins with a savory meat sauce simmered to perfection, 
        blending ground beef, Italian sausage, tomatoes, and aromatic herbs. A creamy ricotta mixture, 
        infused with Parmesan and fresh parsley, adds a velvety richness, while perfectly cooked lasagna noodles provide structure 
        and substance.Each layer is topped with shredded mozzarella, creating a gooey, 
        golden crust as the lasagna bakes to bubbly perfection. 
        This dish is ideal for family dinners, gatherings, or meal prep, 
        as it tastes even better the next day. Serve it with a crisp green salad and garlic bread for a complete Italian-inspired 
        feast that will leave everyone at the table asking for seconds.
